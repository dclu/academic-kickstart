My interests mainly lie in condensed matter systems, where rich phenomena emerge from fundamental rules and elements which have deep connections to high energy theory and mathematics. 

Recently, I've been focused on deconfined quantum criticality, topological phase transitions. Meanwhile, I'm also learning duality web of QFTs, TQFT, characterstic class and knot theory.
